    <h2>Urban Cooling Corridor Construction Planning for Freetown, Sierra Leone</h2>
    <p>This project aims to design a cooling corridor system in Freetown, Sierra Leone that maximizes the cooling benefits of urban trees at the lowest cost.
    It connects areas of high heat exposure, urban amenities, socio-economic activity, and past planting sites from the city's campaign. The corridor follows
    Freetownâ€™s street systems, with some deviations due to data coverage limitations in the Global South.</p>

    <h3>The Workflow is as Follows</h3>

    <div class="workflow_words">
      <p>To construct a resistance surface that represents both the need in heat mitigation and existing green spaces that need to be connected, this project integrates
        remote sensing data from various sources. It includes: Sentinel world cover, VIIRS dark marble (mosaiced through GEE), NOAA air temperature of three daily periods,
        urban amenities (POIs from Google Map API), existing tree planting records (digitized from Freetown Treetracker). We were able to identify top regions of interest,
        and generate "Nodes" of urban forest networks that can be connected through tree corridors.<br>
        The project result involves three kinds of products:
        <ul>
          <li><el>ArcGIS Model Builder: </el>a model that generates different iterations of cooling corridors as a random "Cooling Node" is selected in a hotspot region. The user
          can also input nodes of their choice into the model to generate cooling corridors of lowest cost. The idea of randomness here aims to accomodate the lack of data coverage 
          and resolution in Global South countries. It also incorporates the fact that policy making in Freetown is largely dependent on community-engaed decision making.</li>
          <li><el>Conceptual cooling corridor:  </el>several cooling corridor plans that do not involve road system. It aims to provide a conceptual suggests on potential regions of
            tree planting to connect communities at a regional scale.
          </li>
          <li><el>Cooling corridor along roads: </el>this version of the product takes into account the road systems in Freetown. In this plan, trees are planted along existing roads
          as record in Open Street Map (OSM). However, field works and industrial responses have suggested that the OSM network is partially outdated and there is no existing reliable opensource dataset 
          reliable in Freetown.</li>
        </ul>
